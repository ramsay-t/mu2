Installing
===

1) Make sure the Wrangler sources are installed (see: https://github.com/RefactoringTools/Wrangler).

2) Set the correct path to the Wrangler sources in both Makefile and include/install.hrl.

3) Type *make*.

The shell scripts in *bin/* provide starting points for common usages. The *mu2* script will generate a specified number of mutants into a specified folder, applying one mutation randomly chosen from all the applicable mutations.

The *apply_instrumentation* script will insert logging calls into all functions to track the variable values used in calls. When the mutated module is called it will generate a file named &lt;module&gt;.log that contains one line per function call, in the format: &lt;function name&gt; [arguments list]. The mutated module must be run with the mu2 *ebin* folder in the erlang path.
